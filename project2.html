            In this example, we have created a header, two columns/boxes and a
            footer. On smaller screens, the columns will stack on top of each
            other.

                    London is the capital city of England. It is the most
                    populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan
                    area of over 13 million inhabitants.

                    Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major
                    settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its
                    founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.
